############### STUDY DRILLS - 1 ##############

'''
The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you can't, skip it and come back later.
For this exercise, try these things:
1)Make your script print another line.
2)Make your script print only one of the lines.
3)Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
