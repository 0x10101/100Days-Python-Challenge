# 100Days-Python-Callenge
100 Days of Code - Python


<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Code everyday for 100 days</li>
  <li>There is no minimum time you can invest coding</li>
  <li>If you have exams or just have your hands full and miss a day make sure in the end you add one more day</li>
</ul>

For each day I'm going to make a folder DAY<number> and post all my learning file's and mini-projects I do in that specific day!

The mini-projects will be added to the folder /program too so you ( I.. ) 
can easily access them without searching in the DAY <number> folders.
